## QWERTY-centric layout with heavily modifed layers

Standard QWERTY layout with heavily modified LOWER/RAISE layers. Mostly a work
in progress, the emphasis of this keymap is having most used symbols on &mdash;or
close to&mdash; the home row for an easier typing experience. Note that the USB
polling rate and debounce algorith have been changed in aid of lowering input
lag<sup>1</sup>

Note this keymap also features a *"thumb cluster"* similar to split keyboards
with space, backspace, enter and tab all accessible using your thumbs.

#### LOWER Layer
My most used layer, here you'll find all the symbols needed as close to the
home row as possible.

- Parentheses/braces in the center of the keyboard
- `% ^ & *` moved to home row on ASDF with `! " Â£ $` just above to bring those symbols closer to your fingers
- `\ # = -` and shifted symbols on JKL:
- Other misc keybindings

#### RAISE Layer
- Numpad on left hand
- vim style arrow keys (hkjl)

#### FUNCTIONS Layer
This layer is accessed by double tapping and holding the LOWER key. It currently contains
mousekeys and window resizing/desktop switching shortcuts, and MEH(*n*) keys for launching
programs (in combination with AutoHotKey)


<sup>1</sup> not sure if this is a placebo, but it *feels* more responsive when gaming/typing
